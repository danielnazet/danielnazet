Hi there! My name is Daniel, and I’m 35 years old. I discovered my passion for programming not long ago, but I’ve approached it with serious dedication and full commitment. Currently, I’m transitioning my career to become a professional developer—it’s not an easy journey, but I work hard every day to achieve this goal.

I specialize in frontend development, working with technologies such as React, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React Native and CSS. However, I don’t limit myself to just one area—I’m also growing as a full-stack developer and am open to learning new technologies and programming directions. Being self-taught, I value every opportunity to learn and improve my skills.

Privately, I’m a husband and a father of twins—a daughter and a son. I currently work in the R&D Electronics department at LG, but my ultimate goal is to fully dedicate myself to programming.

I see GitHub Sponsors not just as a way to receive support but also as a source of motivation to continue growing and sharing my projects with others. It’s a vital step in my journey to becoming part of the global programming community.

**My Projects**
At the moment, I’m working on three open-source projects, which, with your support, I can fully realize. These projects might even be useful to others:
