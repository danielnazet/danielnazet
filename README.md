👋 Hi, I’m Daniel! 

👀 I’m interested in JS / HTML / CSS, particularly in building dynamic and interactive web applications with React.

🌱 Currently, I’m learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and how to work with APIs to become a frontend fullstack developer.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects suitable for a junior fullstack developer, junior web development and web app especially those involving React where I can contribute and learn alongside others.
